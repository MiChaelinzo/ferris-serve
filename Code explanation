**Explanation ferris-serve-advance.rs & ferris-serve-basic.rs :**

1. **Dependencies:**  The code uses standard Rust libraries for networking (`std::net`) and file system operations (`std::fs`).
2. **Binding to Port:** The `TcpListener` binds to localhost (`127.0.0.1`) on port 8080. 
3. **Incoming Connections:** The `for` loop iterates through incoming connections.
4. **Request Handling (`handle_connection`):**
   - **Reading the Request:** It reads the first 1024 bytes of the request into a buffer. 
   - **Parsing the Request:** It checks if the request starts with "GET /" to determine the requested file.
   - **Serving Files:** 
     - If the requested file exists, it reads the file content and sets a 200 OK status. 
     - If the file doesn't exist, it returns a 404 NOT FOUND status.
   - **Sending Response:**  It sends the HTTP response, including the status line and the file content (or error message).

**Enhancements (Based on Bounty Objectives):**

* **File Upload (POST):** You'll need to add logic to handle POST requests and write uploaded data to files.
* **Directory Listing (HTML):** You'll need to generate an HTML page dynamically to list the files in the directory. 
* **Directory Creation, File Deletion, Authentication:** These features would require additional code to handle the relevant HTTP requests and implement the logic.

**Improvements:**

1. **Command-Line Arguments:**  The server now takes the port number and the directory to serve as command-line arguments, making it more flexible.
2. **Error Handling:**  The code uses `Result` for error handling and prints error messages to the console.
3. **Multithreading:**  Each incoming connection is handled in a separate thread using `thread::spawn()`. This improves performance, allowing the server to handle multiple requests concurrently. 
4. **Content Type:**  The `get_content_type` function determines the correct MIME type (Content-Type header) based on the file extension, so different types of files (HTML, CSS, images, etc.) are served correctly. 
5. **Request Parsing:** The `parse_request` function extracts the method, path, and HTTP version from the request string.

**Further Enhancements:**

* **File Upload:**  Add logic to handle HTTP POST requests and save the uploaded data to files in the designated directory. 
* **Directory Listing (HTML):**  Generate an HTML page dynamically that lists the files and directories within the served directory.
* **User Authentication:** Implement basic user authentication to restrict access to the server. You can use simple username/password combinations or explore more robust methods.
* **TLS/SSL:**  For secure communication, integrate TLS/SSL support using libraries like `openssl` or `rustls`.  


**Explanation of ferris-serve-advance-user-auth-upload.rs:**

- **File Uploads:**
    - The code now handles POST requests to `/upload`.
    - It parses the `Content-Length`, `Content-Type` (multipart/form-data), and extracts the boundary.
    - A simplified `parse_multipart_data` function is implemented (you might want to use a crate like `multipart` for more robust parsing).
    - The uploaded file is saved to the designated directory. 
- **User Authentication:**
    - The `check_authentication` function now checks for a `Basic` authorization header. 
    - **Important Security Note:** The example uses SHA256 for hashing, but in a production system, use a stronger password hashing algorithm like bcrypt.  **Never store passwords in plain text!**
    - Routes starting with `/protected` require authentication.
- **Error Handling:** 
    - Improved error handling for file reading, parsing, and authentication. 
- **Code Structure:** 
    - Code is more organized with helper functions for request parsing, content-type detection, authentication, and multipart parsing.

**Further Improvements:**

* **Robust Authentication:**  Use bcrypt or Argon2 for password hashing.  Implement a proper authentication system with sessions or JWT tokens.
* **TLS/SSL:**  Use `openssl` or `rustls` to enable HTTPS.
* **Directory Listing:** Generate a dynamic HTML page to list directory contents. 
* **Error Handling:** Improve error handling with custom error types and more informative messages.
* **Web Framework:**  Consider using a framework like Rocket or Actix to structure the code and simplify handling routes, requests, and responses.
